Using Database from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors, we completed all the requirements for our final test
Including :
Preprocessing the data:
Inspected the data types, renamed the columns, handled the null values, and converted the data types from categorical to numeric for processing.
Summarized the data and displayed a correlation matrix.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with at least four visualizations (two must be bar and pie charts) and the other two is box plot and scatter plot.

Used four machine learning models from PySpark:
Random Forest, Gradient Boost Tree, Decision Tree And Neural Network.

Compared the models using metrics like AUC (ROC Curve), Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, and Recall to find the best 2 models.

Selected the two best-performing models and perform hyperparameter tuning to analyze performance changes and pick the best model for this dataset.
